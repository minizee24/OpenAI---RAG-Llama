# OpenAI LLM RAG model

This project uses Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) which is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that combines the strengths of both retrieval- and generative-based artificial intelligence (AI) models. OpenAI API key is used to use the LLM model in the local machine. Then using LlamaIndex library rag model is implemented. Custom dataset is provided to utilize the model for specific applications with high accuracy.
